# Dragon-aid-bot
Dragon-aid is a discord bot that takes d and d info from the 5e srd using http://www.dnd5eapi.co/
I noticed there was no bot to quickly find d and d spells, so I made one! 

COMMANDS:

?spell <spell-name> fetches data for the named spell

?armor <armor-name> fetches data for the named armor

?weapon <weapon-name> fetches data for the named weapon

?feature <feature-name> fetches data for the named feature

?condition <condition-name> fetches data for the named condition.
